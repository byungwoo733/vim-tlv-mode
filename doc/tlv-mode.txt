Introduction ~

The _vim-tlv-mode_ plug-in adds support for Transaction-Level Verilog (TLV for
short) to the Vim text editor. The plug-in is intended to provide everything
needed to efficiently develop TLV code in Vim:

- File type detection
- Syntax highlighting (including an optional color scheme)
- Automatic (smart) indentation
- Automatic text folding
- Checking for syntax errors (work in progress)

Each of the features outlined above is discussed in more detail below.

_Please note that Transaction-Level Verilog is in the process of being launched
as this document is written so I can't provide any public references yet, but
stay tuned: As soon as TLV has been launched I will provide references here._

===============================================================================
                                                   *tlv-mode-install-first-use*
Install & first use ~

Please refer to the installation instructions [1] available on GitHub. Once
you've installed the plug-in try it out: Edit a '*.tlv' file and inspect the
syntax highlighting in '\TLV' code blocks! You can also play around with the
smart indentation to get a feel for how it works.

===============================================================================
                                                            *tlv-mode-features*
Features ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *tlv-mode-file-type-detection*
File type detection ~

Transaction-Level Verilog files are detected in two complementary ways:

1. Files with the '*.tlv' filename extension;
2. Files whose first line consists of the mandatory file format line.

If either of the two conditions above is met the file type detection kicks in.
What this basically means is that you should never have to manually activate
the file type or syntax highlighting; it will be done for you automatically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *tlv-mode-syntax-highlighting*
Syntax highlighting ~

The syntax highlighting mode differentiates between three types of code
regions:

1. The first type of region is marked at its start with the line '\SV',
   these regions contain lines of SystemVerilog [2] code that are passed
   through (unprocessed and uninterpreted) to the translated SystemVerilog
   file. These regions are highlighted using Vim's SystemVerilog syntax
   highlighting support [3] (included in Vim's runtime distribution as the
   'systemverilog' file type).

2. The second type of region is marked at its start with the line '\TLV',
   these regions contain lines of Transaction-Level Verilog code. **This is
   where the syntax highlighting for Transaction-Level Verilog code kicks in
   and where most of the syntax highlighting logic of _vim-tlv-mode_ is
   concentrated.**

3. The third type of region is marked at its start with the line '\SV_plus',
   these regions contain lines of SystemVerilog code with TLV signal
   references.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    *tlv-mode-syntax-highlighting-of-m4-macros*
Syntax highlighting of M4 macros ~

The TLV processing chain runs M4 [4] as an independent preprocessor before any
other processing takes place so M4 macros can be used anywhere (although they
are intended to provide functionality for '\TLV' and '\SV_plus' regions).
Because of this the _vim-tlv-mode_ syntax script uses Vim's M4 syntax
highlighting support [5] to highlight M4 macros embedded in TLV files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   *tlv-mode-recommended-color-scheme-included*
Recommended color scheme included ~

There is a recommended color scheme for editing Transaction-Level Verilog code
and _vim-tlv-mode_ contains a Vim color scheme script called (you guessed it
:-) _tlv_ that provides this recommended color scheme to Vim.

Of course you are free to decide whether to use this color scheme or not, the
choice is up to you. The syntax highlighting mode is intended to work well with
other Vim color schemes as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *tlv-mode-automatic-indentation*
Automatic (smart) indentation ~

The _vim-tlv-mode_ plug-in uses Vim's |'indentexpr'| option to implement smart
indentation (that understands TLV scope rules and knows to ignore line type
characters) and automatically increases the indentation level as needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              *tlv-mode-automatic-text-folding*
Automatic text folding ~

The _vim-tlv-mode_ plug-in uses Vim's |'foldexpr'| option to implement
automatic text folding (that understands TLV scope rules and knows to ignore
line type characters). This method of text folding is already a big improvement
over indentation based folding (because that falls apart as soon as line type
characters are introduced) but it's not perfect yet; I'd like to improve it
further.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          *tlv-mode-checking-for-syntax-errors*
Checking for syntax errors ~

To compile TLV code you need the 'sandpiper' compiler. When the _vim-tlv-mode_
plug-in sees that you have the 'sandpiper' compiler installed it will
automatically run the compiler every time you save a TLV file. If the compiler
reports syntax warnings or errors a |location-list-window| pops up to show you
an overview of compiler messages. When you click on a recognized line in the
location list window you'll automatically jump to the line in the TLV file
where the message was reported.

Please note that this feature is still in development (not finished yet) so for
now the automatic syntax checking is disabled by default. The to-do list in the
file 'TODO.md' contains more details (refer to the version control repository
on GitHub).
